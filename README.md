GD Stats is a discord bot that polls the **Geometry Dash** servers and renders pretty informational images using the received data.

The bot has 2 commands:
* ^stats [USERNAME OR ID]
* ^level [NAME OR ID]

GD Stats is under active development and new features are getting added all the time. You can follow up on progress by
